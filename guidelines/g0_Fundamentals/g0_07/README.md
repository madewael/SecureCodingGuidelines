# Document security-related information
![Author](https://img.shields.io/badge/Author-Oracle-blue.svg)

API documentation should cover security-related information such as required permissions, security-related exceptions, caller sensitivity (see Guidelines 9-8 through 9-11 for additional on this topic), and any preconditions or postconditions that are relevant to security. Documenting this information in comments for a tool such as JavaDoc can also help to ensure that it is kept up to date.
